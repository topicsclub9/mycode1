## Matrix of Destiny Calculation Steps (from YouTube Video Summary)

1.  **Draw the Chart:** Begin by drawing two overlapping squares to create an eight-pointed star shape. Draw a circle in the center, with lines connecting it to all eight points of the star.
2.  **Number Reduction:** All calculations use numbers from 1 to 22. Any number greater than 22 must be reduced by adding its digits (e.g., 23 becomes 2+3=5, 25 becomes 2+5=7, etc.). If the sum is still greater than 22, repeat the process.
3.  **Initial Placement:**
    *   **Day of Birth:** Place the reduced day of birth on the top point of the primary (straight) square.
    *   **Month of Birth:** Place the reduced month of birth on the right point of the primary (straight) square.
    *   **Year of Birth:** Place the reduced year of birth on the bottom point of the primary (straight) square.
    *   **Sum of Day, Month, Year:** Calculate the sum of the reduced day, month, and year. Reduce this sum if it's greater than 22, and place it on the left point of the primary (straight) square.
4.  **Calculating Remaining Points (Primary Square):**
    *   **Top-Right:** Add the reduced Day of Birth and Month of Birth. Reduce if necessary.
    *   **Bottom-Right:** Add the reduced Month of Birth and Year of Birth. Reduce if necessary.
    *   **Bottom-Left:** Add the reduced Year of Birth and the Sum of Day, Month, Year. Reduce if necessary.
    *   **Top-Left:** Add the reduced Day of Birth and the Sum of Day, Month, Year. Reduce if necessary.
5.  **Calculating Inner Points (Diagonal Square):**
    *   **Center Top:** Add the Top and Top-Right points of the primary square. Reduce if necessary.
    *   **Center Right:** Add the Top-Right and Right points of the primary square. Reduce if necessary.
    *   **Center Bottom:** Add the Right and Bottom points of the primary square. Reduce if necessary.
    *   **Center Left:** Add the Bottom and Left points of the primary square. Reduce if necessary.
6.  **Central Point:** Add all four inner points. Reduce if necessary. This is the central energy of the matrix.

**Example (November 25, 1985):**

*   **Day:** 25 -> 2+5 = 7
*   **Month:** 11
*   **Year:** 1985 -> 1+9+8+5 = 23 -> 2+3 = 5

*   **Top (Day):** 7
*   **Right (Month):** 11
*   **Bottom (Year):** 5
*   **Left (Sum):** 7+11+5 = 23 -> 2+3 = 5

*   **Top-Right:** 7+11 = 18
*   **Bottom-Right:** 11+5 = 16
*   **Bottom-Left:** 5+5 = 10
*   **Top-Left:** 7+5 = 12

*   **Center Top:** 7+18 = 25 -> 2+5 = 7
*   **Center Right:** 18+11 = 29 -> 2+9 = 11
*   **Center Bottom:** 11+16 = 27 -> 2+7 = 9
*   **Center Left:** 16+5 = 21

*   **Central Point:** 7+11+9+21 = 48 -> 4+8 = 12

This provides the numerical values for the chart. The next step would be to interpret these numbers based on the 22 Major Arcana of Tarot, which the video briefly mentions but doesn't detail.
